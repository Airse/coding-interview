# Arithmetic Expressions

[Source](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arithmetic-expressions/problem)

5 year old Shinchan had just started learning Mathematics. Meanwhile, one of his studious classmate, Kazama, had already written a basic calculator which supports only 3 operations on integral numbers: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Since he had just learnt about these operations, he didn't have knowledge of precedence of operators, and in his calculator all operators had same precedence and left associativity.

As always Shinchan started to irritate him with his silly question. He gave Kazama a list of  integers and asked him to insert one of the above operators between each pair of consecutive integer such that the result obtained after feeding the resulting expression in Kazama's calculator is divisible by `101`. At core Shinchan is a good guy, so he gave only that list of integers for which the answer always exists.

Can you help Kazama in creating the required expression? If multiple solutions exists, print any one of them.
