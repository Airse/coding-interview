Sandy likes palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, madam is a palindrome.

On her birthday, Sandy's uncle, Richie Rich, offered her an `n`-digit check which she refused because the number was not a palindrome. Richie then challenged Sandy to make the number palindromic by changing no more than `k` digits. Sandy can only change 1 digit at a time, and cannot add digits to (or remove digits from) the number.

Given `k` and an `n`-digit number, help Sandy determine the largest possible number she can make by changing `<= k` digits.
