# Find the Closest Palindrome

[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/description/)

Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.
The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example:
```
Input: "123"
Output: "121"

Input: "1"
Output: "0"

Input: "100"
Output: "99"
```

Note:
1. The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
2. If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
