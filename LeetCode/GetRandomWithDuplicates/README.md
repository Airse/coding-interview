# Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

Note: Duplicate elements are allowed.
1. insert(val): Inserts an item val to the collection.
2. remove(val): Removes an item val from the collection if present.
3. getRandom: Returns a random element from current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same value the collection contains.
