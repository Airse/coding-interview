# DFS: Connected Cell in a Grid

[Source](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-connected-cell-in-a-grid)

Consider a matrix with  rows and  columns, where each cell contains either a `0` or a `1` and any cell containing a `1` is called a filled cell. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Note that each cell in a region is connected to at least one other cell in the region but is not necessarily directly connected to all the other cells in the region.
