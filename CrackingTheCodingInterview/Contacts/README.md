# Tries: Contacts

[Source](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-contacts)

We're going to make our own Contacts application! The application must perform two types of operations:

1. add name, where `name` is a string denoting a contact name. This must store  as a new contact in the application.
find partial, where `partial` is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the number of contacts starting with `partial` and print the count on a new line.
2. Given  sequential add and find operations, perform each operation in order.
